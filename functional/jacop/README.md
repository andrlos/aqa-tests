# Jacop testsuite

Read about the Jacop project [here](https://github.com/radsz/jacop/blob/develop/README.md).

## Why use JaCoP for JVM testing?
### 1. Verifying JVM Features with Diverse Workloads
JaCoP is computationally intensive and exercises a wide range of JVM features, including:
- **Threading and Concurrency**: Parallel constraint solving and search strategies.
- **Memory Management**: Stresses garbage collection and memory allocation with frequent object creation and disposal.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Tests precision and performance of JVM's mathematical computations.

Running JaCoP's internal tests ensures the JVM can reliably handle these workloads.

### 2. Stress Testing JVM Limits
Constraint programming frameworks push the JVM to its limits by:
- Generating large object graphs.
- Using deep recursion in constraint propagation and search.
- Performing CPU-intensive computations.

Including JaCoP tests allows for effective stress testing, helping uncover issues in memory management, Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, and performance.

### 3. Assessing Determinism and Correctness
JaCoP relies on consistent execution semantics, making its tests ideal for verifying:
- **Deterministic behavior**: Ensures JVM outputs remain consistent across runs.
- **Correctness under optimization**: Detects subtle bugs in JIT optimizations or threading mechanisms.

### 4. Alignment with Real-World Use Cases
Constraint programming is widely used in fields such as scheduling, optimization, and AI. Running JaCoP tests provides insights into how well the JVM supports demanding real-world applications.

### 5. Providing Comprehensive JVM Test Coverage
JaCoP tests help ensure:
- Exercise of less commonly used Java features (e.g., specific concurrency primitives, complex class loading).
- Validation of JVM components such as the garbage collector, JIT compiler, and memory subsystems, using a sophisticated real-world application.

### 6. Maintaining Confidence in Upgrades
JaCoP tests serve as a **regression test suite**, verifying that changes to the JVM (e.g., compiler updates, garbage collector improvements) do not introduce regressions. Successful execution ensures confidence in new JVM versions.
